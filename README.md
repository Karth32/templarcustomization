# templarcustomization
A wurm unlimited mod to allow players to rename their deed guards.

Right now there is little customization. Players can create a spirit contract item to allow them to rename their own spirit
templars/shadows. The requirements are descent papryusmaking skill, along with a blood from any unique creature, a shaft and 3 
pieces of paper. 

Currently GMs with a power of 2 or greater can use a black or ivory wand to force a name change with a spirit templar/shadow.

This uses a bad word filter (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UMi1w_T593iuSi8q7QSTdlQkNJB6bEkeGKveOadS5sU/) and filters
names using non-alphabetical or numerical characters.
